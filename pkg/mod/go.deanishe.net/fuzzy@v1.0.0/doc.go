Package fuzzy implements fuzzy matching and sorting.

Sort() and Match() implement fuzzy search, e.g. "of" will match "OmniFocus"
and "got" will match "Game of Thrones".

Match() compares a query and a string, while Sort() sorts a type that
implements fuzzy.Sortable. Both return Result structs for each compared string.


The algorithm is based on Forrest Smith's reverse engineering of Sublime Text's search:

It additionally strips diacritics from sort keys if the query is ASCII.
